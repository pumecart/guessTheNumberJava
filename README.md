# Overview

This is my Guess the Number application in Java.  I decided on this project because I wanted to learn how to use Java in a fun way.  This video will show you how I went about the coding.  I also added the ability for the user to input the range of numbers that they would like to be guessing from.  That is something unique to the YouTube tutorials that I watched.  

Here is a link to your YouTube demonstration. It is a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code where I will focus mainly on what I learned creating this app.
